A Solitaire variant of DC Comics Deck-Building Game, based on Crisis Expansion Pack 1 Solo Play, with the following modifications:

- Choose 2 Super Heroes.
- Play with 4 Super-Villains.
- Do not use Crisis cards; before a Super-Villain can be defeated, you must remove all Villains from the Line-Up.
- Board set up as normal, except turn the Weakness deck face-down. It will be used as the game timer.
- At the end of each of turn, flip over a face-down Weakness card.
- If you need to flip over a face-down Weakness card and cannot, time has run out and you lose the game.
- Defeat all of the Super-Villains in the stack before time runs out. Do this, and you win!
- Weakness cards gained are taken from the face-up pile of Weakness cards already flipped over. If
there are none don't gain any.

Uses the base game, Crisis Expansion Pack 1, and Crossover Pack 1.
